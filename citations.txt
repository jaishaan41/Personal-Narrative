What I prompted:

ChatGpt why do i get the following error?
/SceneTwo.java:36: error: no suitable method found for drawText(java.lang.String) drawText(bestsong[row][col]); ^ method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int,double) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) /SceneTwo.java:39: error: no suitable method found for drawText(java.lang.String) drawText(bestsong[row][col]); ^ method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int,double) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) /SceneTwo.java:42: error: no suitable method found for drawText(java.lang.String) drawText(bestsong[row][col]); ^ method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int,double) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) /SceneTwo.java:45: error: no suitable method found for drawText(java.lang.String) drawText(bestsong[row][col]); ^ method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length) method org.code.theater.Scene.drawText(java.lang.String,int,int,double) is not applicable (actual and formal argument lists differ in length)


What response I recieved:

Ahhh okay this error makes sense.

Your drawText() method requires coordinates.

From the error message:

drawText(String, int, int)
drawText(String, int, int, double)


That means you must pass:

drawText(text, x, y);


OR

drawText(text, x, y, size);


Right now you're only doing:

drawText(bestsong[row][col]);


That’s why Java is yelling at you.
